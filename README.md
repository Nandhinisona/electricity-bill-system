# electricity-bill-system
 The aim of the project is to develop a system that is meant to partially computerize the work performed
 in the Electricity Board like generating monthly electricity bill, consumed units, previous and present units of energy meter.
 This mini project is developed in C language and different variables and strings have been used to for the development of the project.
 I have used Dev c++ IDE to compile and run this project. In this system, user has to enter the name ,address, previous and
 present recorded units in energy meter and total sum of amount is displayed. The details about the different rates to domestic user 
  based on the consumed unit is given in program for better understanding and also to discourage large consumption of energy.  
 This example illustrates the concept of structures and conditional statements in C language.
  Here structure variable bill is declared which has structure template name,address, previous and present units. 
 The structure represents the information of a customer and the program calculates the cost by checking previous and present unit and 
 difference of them is used to calculate the amount. It's easy to operate and understand code by users. There is no error and warning 
 content in the  project.  The design is so simple that user won't find it difficult to use and navigate.
